  This binding allows to define the pin of the GPIO to be owned by the domain.
  It does not provide any specific driver.
  It enables the following functionalities:

  - Generate the right UICR marking the domain to own the selected pin.
  - Access to pins by the macros from the `zephyr/devicetree/gpio.h` file,
    which increases the hardware abstraction.
