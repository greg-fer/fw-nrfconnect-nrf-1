The |NCS| is a scalable and unified software development kit for building low-power wireless applications based on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF70, and nRF91 Series wireless devices.
It offers an extensible framework for building size-optimized software for memory-constrained devices as well as powerful and complex software for more advanced devices and applications.

It integrates the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS) and a wide range of complete applications, samples, and protocol stacks such as Bluetooth® Low Energy, Bluetooth mesh, Matter, Thread/Zigbee, Wi-Fi®, and LTE-M/NB-IoT/GPS, TCP/IP.
It also includes middleware such as CoAP, MQTT, LwM2M, various libraries, hardware drivers, Trusted Firmware-M for security, and a secure bootloader (MCUboot).

The |NCS| supports :ref:`Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS <requirements>` for development.
